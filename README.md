# Processing

### Learn Processing

Some quick stuff I've assembled to help anyone learn Processing, and to help myself as well because I'm really not that good and it would be cool to learn some more for myself as well. I hope that I will be able to go over:

**Basics**
 - size(width, height);
 - background(red, green, blue);
 - void setup() and draw()
 - if/else
 
**Shapes**
 - Just the normal shapes, like ellipse(x, y, width, height), rect(x, y, width, height), etc.
